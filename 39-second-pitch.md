# Idynify Scout — 39-Second Pitch

You know how B2B sales teams waste 10+ hours every week searching LinkedIn and databases, trying to figure out who to target—and still end up with lists of companies that don't convert?

Idynify Scout solves that.

Our AI strategist, Barry, doesn't just give you data—he acts like a senior GTM advisor. He challenges your assumptions, validates your ideal customer profile, and analyzes your market to deliver a scored, prioritized list of companies that actually match what you're looking for.

In under an hour, you go from "who should we target?" to "here are the 20 companies we should pursue first, and here's why."

No expensive SDR team. No generic databases. No guesswork.

Just intelligent targeting for $9.99.

Stop prospecting. Start strategizing.
