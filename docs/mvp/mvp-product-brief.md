# MVP Product Brief — Idynify Scout
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Baseline
**Last Updated:** December 15, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

**Idynify Scout** is an AI-powered B2B lead generation platform that helps small GTM teams go from "who should we target?" to "here's our prioritized list of companies" in under an hour—without the manual slog of database searches and guesswork.

**The Problem:**
Finding the right companies to target is time-consuming, expensive, and often wrong. Sales teams waste 10+ hours per week searching LinkedIn, Apollo, and databases, only to end up with unqualified leads that don't convert.

**The Solution:**
Barry (our AI agent) acts as a senior GTM strategist—challenging your assumptions, analyzing your market, and delivering scored companies that actually match your ideal customer profile.

**MVP Scope:**
- **RECON (Tier 1):** Market intelligence and strategic planning
- **SCOUT (Tier 2):** Company discovery, scoring, and mission-based selection
- **Pricing:** $9.99 unlocks both tiers

**Not Included in MVP:**
- **HUNTER (Tier 3):** Contact discovery and outreach automation (future paid upgrade)

## Product Vision

### The Big Picture

**Today's Reality:**
B2B prospecting is broken. Tools give you data, but not direction. You're drowning in company lists but starving for insight.

**Our Vision:**
Idynify Scout makes targeting *intelligent*. Instead of spray-and-pray, you get AI-guided precision. Instead of guessing, you get validation. Instead of lists, you get *strategy*.

**3-Year North Star:**
Every B2B company with <50 employees uses Idynify Scout to define, discover, and engage their ideal customers—eliminating the need for expensive SDR teams and generic lead databases.

### Why Now?

**Market Conditions:**
- AI is mature enough to analyze markets (Claude, GPT-4)
- APIs provide rich company data (Apollo, Clearbit, ZoomInfo)
- Small teams need GTM leverage (10-person startups doing $5M ARR)
- Buyers expect personalization (spray-and-pray is dead)

**Competitive Landscape:**
- **Lead databases (Apollo, ZoomInfo):** Data without direction
- **Outreach tools (Outreach, SalesLoft):** Execution without strategy
- **AI copilots (Clay, Relevance):** Powerful but complex, requires expertise

**Our Differentiation:**
We're the *strategy layer* before execution. We don't just give you companies—we help you think through who to target and why.
