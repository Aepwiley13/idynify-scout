# MVP PRODUCT BRIEF
## Idynify Scout MVP - Learning Engine Edition

---

## **Problem Statement**
B2B sales professionals (founders, SDRs, BDRs, solopreneurs at 1-50 employee companies) struggle to quickly generate qualified contacts that perfectly match their Ideal Customer Profile. Current tools require manual filtering, lack personalization, and don't learn from user behavior.

---

## **Solution**
Idynify Scout is a 3-phase lead generation platform that learns from user behavior to continuously improve targeting accuracy:
- **RECON Phase**: Build ICP → Generate AI Brief → Match Companies
- **SCOUT Phase**: Select Companies → Review Suggested Contacts → Accept/Reject → Auto-Enrich
- **LEAD REVIEW Phase**: Validate Lead Accuracy → Export/Call → Platform Learns

---

## **Target User**
Founders, SDRs, BDRs, and solopreneurs in B2B sales (1-50 employees) who need fast, accurate prospecting automation.

---

## **Success Metric**
User upgrades to Scout ($10-49.99/month) and enriches at least 1 contact, generating their first Lead.

---

## **Key Value Propositions**
1. **Speed**: ICP → Companies → Contacts → Enriched Leads in minutes
2. **Accuracy**: Simple learning engine adapts to user preferences via Accept/Reject feedback
3. **Control**: 5 contacts/company/day, 50 leads/week cap prevents overload
4. **Barry AI Guide**: Space-themed mascot provides feedback ("Barry learned from your action")
