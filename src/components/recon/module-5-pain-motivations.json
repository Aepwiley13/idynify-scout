Only not a 10 because company isn't at risk of going out of business (yet) - but another year of this and they might be.",
        "comparisonToOtherPains": "This is their #1 pain right now. Other pains exist (product gaps, marketing channel issues) but this is the blocker preventing them from scaling revenue. If they don't fix sales, nothing else matters. CEO agrees this is top priority."

    "rawAnswers": {
      "primaryPain": "Our sales team is drowning in manual prospecting work - spending 3-4 hours per day on research, writing emails, and data entry instead of actually selling. We can't scale our outbound motion without throwing more bodies at the problem, and our response rates are terrible (<2%) so all that manual work feels pointless.",
      "painCost": "Each SDR wastes 15-20 hours/week on manual work. At $75K salary per SDR, that's $360K/year in wasted time across 5 reps. Plus we're missing $500K+ in pipeline because we can only prospect to 25% of our addressable market. Lost 2 SDRs to burnout in last 3 months ($30K each to replace).",
      "triedBefore": "Tried Salesforce with Outreach but too complex and expensive ($150K/year). Hired offshore agency but quality was terrible. Tried basic email tools like Mailshake but no real personalization so response rates stayed low.",
      "whyFailed": "Salesforce/Outreach took 3 months to implement, team never adopted it. Agency didn't understand our ICP and sent generic garbage. Basic tools just do mail merge - no intelligence.",
      "doNothing": "We'll miss Q4 targets and annual goals. CEO will lose confidence. Board will ask why sales can't scale with the funding we just raised. More SDRs will burn out and quit. Competitors will steal market share while we're stuck in manual mode.",
      "urgentTrigger": "Q4 is coming up (90 days to hit annual target). CEO is already asking questions. Just lost 2 SDRs to burnout. Competitor announced $20M raise and is hiring aggressively. Board meeting in 60 days where I need to show pipeline growth.",
      "successLooksLike": "Double meetings booked from 4/week to 8/week per SDR. Cut manual work from 4 hours/day to <1 hour. Generate $500K in outbound pipeline this quarter. Stop SDR churn - get retention above 85%. Prove sales can scale without just adding headcount.",
      "workarounds": "SDRs work early mornings and late nights to get prospecting done. I personally write all email templates and they copy-paste. We ignore 70% of our addressable market and only prospect to perfect-fit accounts. It's not working.",
      "whoElseFeels": "CEO feels it (can't show growth to investors), CFO feels it (poor sales efficiency metrics), SDRs feel it (burning out), Marketing feels it (their leads aren't being worked), and honestly the whole company because sales is the bottleneck to everything.",
      "churnReasons": "With past tools: didn't integrate with Salesforce properly, onboarding was too complex, AI messages sounded robotic, support was slow to respond, pricing increased unexpectedly after first year."
