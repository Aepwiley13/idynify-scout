        "performanceBased": "Poor quarterly results trigger immediate evaluation. Missing revenue targets (trailing 10-20% behind plan) forces VP Sales to find solutions fast. SDR churn (>30% annually) creates urgency to fix broken processes. These performance issues create board pressure and job risk.",
        "timeBased": "Recent funding (Series A/B) opens budget window and creates growth expectations. New fiscal year brings fresh budgets and new priorities. Q4 is critical - if they're behind on targets, they'll buy anything that can help them catch up before year-end.",

        "contentPreferences": "Prefer hands-on experience (demos, trials) over reading (whitepapers, case studies). Want to see the tool working with their data. Don't have patience for long analyst reports. Quick YouTube demos and peer testimonials are most effective.",
        "researchDepth": "Moderate - they do enough research to avoid bad decisions but aren't exhaustive. Typically evaluate 2-3 vendors seriously, not 10+. Focus on pragmatic 'will this work?' questions rather than feature comparisons. Time-constrained so research is efficient, not comprehensive.",
        "peerInfluence": "Very high - peer recommendation can compress entire sales cycle. If trusted peer says 'this tool saved my team', they'll fast-track evaluation. Negative peer feedback can kill deals instantly. Peer references are often the final decision factor."
